### Problem Statement:
Task<br>
Your task is to build an engine that combines the concepts of OCR and NLP that accepts a .jpg file as input, extracts the text, if any, and classifies sentiment as positive or negative. If the text sentiment is neutral or an image file does not have any text, then it is classified as random.
